# Pricing Optimization System

A data-driven pricing optimization project that models customer demand, estimates price elasticity, and identifies revenue-maximizing prices using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Business Problem
Setting the right price is critical for maximizing revenue. Businesses often struggle to understand how price changes impact customer demand. This project builds a pricing optimization system to recommend optimal prices based on demand behavior.

## Dataset
- Synthetic e-commerce pricing data
- Features:
  - Product price
  - Quantity sold
- Data is generated to simulate real-world demand behavior

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand price–demand relationship
2. Price elasticity modeling using regression
3. Revenue simulation across multiple price points
4. Identification of revenue-maximizing price
5. Business insight generation and visualization

## Results
- Quantified demand sensitivity to price changes
- Identified optimal price points that maximize revenue
- Compared baseline pricing with optimized pricing strategy

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
