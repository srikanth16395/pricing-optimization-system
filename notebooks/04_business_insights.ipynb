    "This project analyzes the relationship between product price and customer demand to identify a revenue-maximizing pricing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using price elasticity modeling and revenue simulation:\n",
    "- Demand was found to be **relatively inelastic**\n",
    "- Revenue increases as price increases within the tested range\n",
    "- Pricing optimization offers a significant opportunity to improve revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates how data-driven pricing decisions can directly impact business performance.\n"

    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demand is relatively inelastic**\n",
    "   - Estimated price elasticity of demand: **−0.264**\n",
    "   - Customers are not highly sensitive to price changes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Price significantly influences demand**\n",
    "   - The relationship between price and demand is statistically significant (p < 0.001)\n",
    "   - Price alone explains a large portion of demand variability (R² ≈ 0.86)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Revenue increases with price**\n",
    "   - Revenue simulation shows higher prices lead to higher total revenue\n",
    "   - The revenue-maximizing price lies above the current average price\n"

    "## Revenue Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current pricing does not maximize revenue\n",
    "- Simulated pricing scenarios indicate a potential revenue uplift of **~35%**\n",
    "- Because demand is inelastic, revenue growth is driven more by **pricing strategy** than by increasing sales volume\n"

    "## Business Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, the following pricing strategy is recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradually increase prices while monitoring demand response\n",
    "- Focus on pricing optimization rather than volume-based growth\n",
    "- Use controlled experiments (A/B testing) to validate price changes in production\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach balances revenue growth with customer retention.\n"

    "  - Competitor pricing\n",
    "  - Customer segmentation\n",
    "  - Promotional effects\n",
    "- The optimal price was identified within a predefined simulation range\n",
